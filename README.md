M06 Project Introduction and Project Status Report

Github link: https://github.com/Farrun/AlexanderBenFinalProject.git

Completed:
-I have successfully connected to FedEx and UPS APIs
-I have drawn information from the APIs
-I have created a sorting algorithm to parse through the submitted tracking numbers and sort them by shipping service.
-If the tracking number is a FedEx number I have made it so the tracking status is displayed.


Problems:
-I am unable to get USPS to work with me to get API access. 
-I have not had time to go and clean the code. (I am having major brain farts and I know there are a lot of ways to make my code cleaner.)
-UPS does not have test tracking numbers.


Next Steps:
-Set up “Shipping Status” for UPS tracking numbers
-Set up GUI
-Adjust code to account for GUI
-Try to add a better Section for USPS since API access is not granted.
-Add Input validation.
